            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>Of the Inducements to a Treaty.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F either the reſpect which is due to God, or the conſideration of our own ſafety, or the deſire and hope of a happy iſſue to our publick underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, can move and affect conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and rational men, to a matter of duty which is eaſily performed, then upon theſe inducements a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between godly Miniſters, who have hitherto ſought joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a Reformation; but now are divided about the way of advancing it, ſhould be ſet a foot.</p>
               <p>For firſt, in reſpect of Gods Commandements, and of the Miniſterial work of the Goſpel: there is nothing ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to us in the Word; as the way of Love, of Unity, of Peace, and of brotherly kindnes; whereby we are obliged to provoke one another unto all good works, and to avoid all occaſions of offences which are diſhonourable unto the name
<pb facs="tcp:192229:2"/> of God, and to the Holy Profeſſion: now to bring this to paſſe amongſt us, nothing can at this time be ſo effectual as a Treaty, to bring godly Miniſters together, that they may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand rightly one another, and be joyned in one ſpirit, and one mind, for their mutual edification.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in reſpect of our own ſafety, there is nothing that can prevent the imminent dangers, whereinto unavoidably we muſt fall, by theſe diviſions, and heart-burnings if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, but an amiable Treaty; that ſame better aſſurance being had of each others intentions: thereby a reconcilement may be wrought in our broken affections; for if this diſtance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſtand continue, it will not only grow inſenſibly greater and greater, through the working of our corruptions; but through the practices of common enemies, who cunningly blow the Coales of our diſcontentments, it will ſoone break forth into open hoſtility, and prove in end our finall overthrow and deſolation: whereat our adverſaries will Triumph, as at the revenge of all the evils, which by our former Conjunction, did befall them.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, in reſpect of the iſſue of our hopes in theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings: as it is not rationally poſſible to expect any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſucceſs therein, without the ſettlement and quieting of the ſpirits of thoſe that are to be the joynt-actors thereof: ſo it is not imaginable, that their ſpirits can be ſetled or quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards each other, except they underſtand one another, and be ſatisfied in each others aimes, better then of late they have been; and this cannot be effected any other way but by a Treaty: all the comforts then which we can rationally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in the purchaſe of our liberty, from all theſe endeavours, and all the credit which amongſt Forraigners, is to be wiſhed for towards our undertakings, depends wholly upon a better ſettlement of our Affaires: this upon a better intelligence with one another, and this upon a friendly Treaty to reconcile dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and divided affections, which onely can fruſtrate the enjoyment of our hopes.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the proper Aime and Deſign thereof.</head>
               <p>AS our Aimes are, ſo our Deſignes will be contrived in ſome proportion thereunto, if then in this Treaty our firſt Aime be above all things to advance the glory of God in the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb facs="tcp:192229:3"/> of the Goſpel, by our unblameable walking before him in his wayes of Truth, Love, and Peace, and our next Aimes ſubordinate hereunto, be to remove offenſive Cariages, to rectifie mutual miſtakes, to beget a good intelligence, in reference to common and neceſſary concernments, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree upon meanes and wayes of mutual edification; to ſeeke a Concurrence to uphold the holy Profeſſion in things wherein there is a full agreement: Then the deſign of the Treaty ſhould not be to diſpute and debate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of particular intereſt, and to juſtifie our ſelves, or condemn others in things paſt; but to deliberate and conſult about the undoubted means and wayes, how according to the will of God, the forementioned Aimes may be advanced with joynt conſent and brotherly correſpondency in time to come better then heretofore: notwithſtanding ſome latitude of different opinions and practices, which in circumſtantial matters will fall in, and mutually ought to be tolerated, without giving or taking offence thereat.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>How the Treaty may become ſuccesfull towards this Deſigne.</head>
               <p>TO work out this Deſign towards thoſe ends, there muſt needs be ſome Preparatives uſed towards the bringing on of the Treaty; and ſome Rules ſetled, how to proceed therein ſuitable to the Aimes of Truth and Peace.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Concerning the Preparatives.</head>
                  <p>It is in many things a certain Truth: <hi>Dimidium facti qui bene coepit habet,</hi> and to begin a work of this nature well, there is nothing ſo material as to prevent ſiniſter impreſſions; and again, a rational confidence of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of each others intentions towards it, and thereupon to lay an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon both parties to be conſtant towards the proſecution thereof, and to do all this, I ſhall humbly offer theſe following Expedients.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Both parties muſt be made throughly acquainted with the real de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, and fully aſſured, that nothing is pretended, but what is really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as in the preſence of God. Now to acquaint them with the real Deſigne, and beget this confidence in them; ſome chuſe moderate, known, and godly men, which are of repute for judgment and integrity with both ſides; are to be made uſe of, to inſinuate the Deſign unto them: as from themſelves by the dictates of their own Conſcience, leſt it ſeeme to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſome plot in the State upon them, which to prevent meanes ſhould be uſed to bring ſome of each ſide together, to ſet them upon the drawing up, or upon the approving of a plat-form of a Treaty, conducing to theſe ends: obliging them to acquaint their Brethren of each ſide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as a matter of neceſſary advice which they think themſelves obliged to ſuggeſt; for nothing but this will prevent objections, &amp; daſh jealouſies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the mindes of moderate and leading men are thus ſome-what prepared, &amp; the fiercer ſort taken off from the edge of their fearful ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs; then ſome forme of a Declaration ſhould be at hand, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb facs="tcp:192229:4"/> to thoſe that ſhould approve of the deſign, that ſetting their hands to it, they may ſhew their willingneſs to concur with others in a Treaty of Reconcilement, and to be engaged in the proſecution thereof by way of Councel and advice.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſubſcriptions of both ſides being gained ſeverely to the ſame draught: the Ruling power ſhould be made acquainted with the free inclinations of both parties to a Treaty among themſelves, and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and concurrence ſhould be deſired towards the advancement thereof; not only that he may not be poſſeſſed with any jealouſie againſt it; or receive ſiniſter &amp; falſe informations concerning it; but that he ſhould be intreated to depute ſome of the Councel of State to be preſent at it, as well to aſſiſt with advice towards the furthering thereof, as in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forme of proceeding and cariage of buſineſſes to give countenance thereunto, that it may be of a publick nature, and freed from diſturbances and contempt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When the ruling power ſhould have approved of the Deſigne, and appointed ſome to be preſent at it to theſe effects: the firſt meeting ſhould be appointed for a Faſt wherein both parties ſhould humble their ſoules joyntly before God, confeſſing their ſins and miſcarriages, praying unto him for grace in time to come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And at the end of that Action they ſhould ratifie and declare unto each other, as in the preſence of God their willingneſs to be mutually reconciled, as Brethren in the Goſpel ought to be according to Gods will; and to that effect, that they are reſolved not onely to treat ingenuouſly and lovingly to rectifie things that are amiſſe; but that they will endeavour in all their privat and publick Cariages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each other, and in reference to the work in hand, to be without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and not to ſuffer any animoſities, clamors, or complaints to break forth, eſpecially in a publick way of preaching or writing; and in caſe any unexpected matters of grievance ſhould fall in on either ſide, that they ſhould not be inſtantly imputed unto, or laid open before all; but that on each ſide ſome ſhould be appointed, to whom ſuch grievances ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; that a friendly courſe may be taken to rectifie the ſame, &amp; to make theſe Reſolutions more valid; ſome Act might be drawn up containing theſe promiſes, and the names of thoſe that ſhould be the hearers of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances on each ſide; which Act ſhould be ſubſcribed by all the Members of each ſide, and delivered to the other party as a mutual aſſurance of their voluntary engagement thereunto, nor would it be amiſſe that they ſhould joyn to intreat the Ruling power, that he would by his influence over the publick, take notice of ſuch as ſhould be offenſive in any ſuch kind, and to appoint ſome who ſhould call them to an account of ſuch proceedings, wherein they ſhould ſeeme to diſturbe the peaceable inclinations of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who are ſeeking the wayes of mutual Reconciliation.</p>

                     <hi>well ordered is finiſhed.</hi> There is much truth in this ſaying: If then we can fore-caſt the way of ordering all things ſo juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and equally towards the fore-mentioned common aimes of the Treaty, that neither ſide ſhall finde any cauſe of exception thereat, we may hope that God will bleſſe this deſigne, and not ſuffer it to miſcarry. And to this effect I ſhall offer theſe following thoughts, as an humble advice to be conſidered by thoſe that ſhall think themſelvees concerned therein.</p>
                  <p>I conceive then, that this Treaty (that it may reach the ends fore-mentioned, and be ſubſervient to the deſigne in hand) ſhould be ordered in reſpect of the places of meeting; and in reſpect of the proceedings of parties in thoſe places.</p>
                  <p>The place of meeting ſhould be ſuch wherein both parties may have a diſtinct chamber to meet by themſelves, &amp; a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon room wherein to meet and appear before the Deputies of the ruling power. In the common room there ſhould be three Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: one where the Deputy or Deputies of the State ſhould ſit at; and the other two ſet oppoſite to one another where the treating parties ſhould ſit at.</p>
                  <p>The proceedings of the parties in each of their places, ſhould be regulated by the ſame Rules as well of actions as of confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
                  <p>The actions are of two ſorts; ſome are to be of each party within it ſelf; ſome of both parties towards each other.</p>
                  <p>To regulate the proceedings of each party within it ſelfe, that it may not be ſubdivided, and claſh about its own procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, I would adviſe thus:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that all who ſhould have ſubſcribed the firſt Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the ſecond Act, to meet and to treat; ſhould come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to chuſe from among themſelves one or two Scribes; and three or four who ſhould be called Treaters in the name of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they ſhould determine a <hi>Directory</hi> for the actions and duties of their Scribes and Treaters, leſt they take too much upon them over their brethren, and their misbehaviours in their places, redound to the diſturbance of the Treaty. And I ſuppoſe this <hi>Directory</hi> might be to this effect:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That nothing ſhould be counted an act of the Treaty;
<pb facs="tcp:192229:6"/> but that which paſſeth from one party to the other in the name of all in writing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That no writing ſhould be given by either party to their Treaters to be offered to the other ſide as an act of their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but that wherin all the ſubſcribers to the Treaty on that ſide fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which it is offered, do agree, <hi>nemine contradicente:</hi> for if any do contradict, it cannot be counted an Act of the whole party; and neither party ſhould be divided within it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That to draw thoſe writings whereunto all of each ſide within themſelves ſhould agree; or from which none ſhould diſagree, the method ſhould be this: At the end of every mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting let a point of deliberation be named, which ſhall be the ſubject of the Treaty at the next joynt-meeting. Let a due time be allowed to think upon that point: Let every one of the Subſcribers be obliged to bring his advice concerning that point in writing expreſſed in briefe and orderly Aphoriſmes: Let all thoſe writings be put into two or three hands, who ſhall ſum them up in that wherein they all agree: let that ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary draught be read at their peculiar meeting, that all may approve, or at leaſt none be concluded in that which he might happily diſapprove. Then let it be put into the hand of the Treaters, to be delivered at the common meeting of both parties to the other ſide as an act of Treaty.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That no Treater be allowed to ſay or do any thing in the name of all, but that which he ſhall be directed to ſay and doe by ali: and if he ſhould ſay or do otherwiſe any thing, it ſhall be free for any to ſtand up and diſclaim that which he ſhall ſay and do, declaring it not to be valid in the name of all.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That all the appointed Treaters ſhould be obliged to be alwayes preſent at all the meetings, and in caſe of neceſſary abſence, to get ſome body of their brethren to ſupply their places, leſt the Treaty might be prejudiced thereby.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That the Scribes of each ſide ſhould keep all the writings which every one ſhall give in upon all matters of deliberation; and that a double of the ſummary collection of Suffrages, ſhall be in a readineſſe for every one who will take a copy of it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That in the peculiar meetings no conſtant and perpetuall Chairman ſhall be appointed, but that every one ſhall preſide therein as it falleth out to be his turn according to the order wherein his name ſhall be found in the Liſt of ſubſcriptions
<pb facs="tcp:192229:7"/> unto the firſt declaration for a Treaty.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That the Chairmans office ſhall be, 1. to begin and end the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar meeting with a prayer, 2. To receive the ſuffrages of delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in writing, and get a Committee of two or three at the moſt, to make a ſummary draught of conſent, 3. to get the peculiar times of peculiar meetings appointed, ſo that all things may be prepared for the common meeting with the other ſide.</p>
                  <p>To regulate the proceedings of the one ſide towards the other at the common meeting, let both parties at the time appointed appeare with their Scribes and Treaters: Let the Treaters deliver to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (after a publick reading of that which they are to deliver) the acts of their advice upon the point whereof the Treaty is to be at that time. Let the precedency in reading and delivering acts be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudinary, as alſo in beginning and ending the common meeting with prayers, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſide whoſe turn it ſhall be to pray, ſhall be laſt in delivering its act and advice to the other. Let a new point of deliberation be nominated immediatly after both acts are delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſome propoſition made by way of Querie agreed upon and put to paper concerning it: and to doe this, ſome two of each ſide ſhould be deputed to draw it up, and offer it to the liking of both parties: Let the papers which are given by one ſide to the other, be read the ſecond time, and an offer made by thoſe that deliver them, that if any of the other ſide ſhould deſire any termes to be opened, or doubtfull expreſſions to be explained, that they ſhould make their Querie of the thing which in the writing ſhould ſeem to them to be doubtfull, and that the ſenſe thereof ſhould be made plain unto them, Let the papers which at each meeting are delivered and explained by one ſide to another, be taken into conſideration by the ſide which doth receive them, to this effect, that it ſhould return thereupon at the next meeting an anſwer declaring how far it doth conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: or in caſe it ſhould not yeeld any conſent at all; or agree unto unto the ſubſtance thereof; that then it ſhould offer to the ſide from which it received the paper at the former meeting, ſome expedients tending to bring forth an agreement.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the Actions: as for the Conferences they in like manner are to be of two ſorts; ſome which each party ſhould enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain within it ſelf: ſome which may be between both parties at their common meetings.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the conferences of each party within it ſelf, although nothing can be preſcribed to prejudge the liberty of Brethren, yet
<pb facs="tcp:192229:8"/> advice may be offered for their edification and prevention of ſubdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, I ſhall then deſire it may be conſidered, whether theſe Rules will not be found expedient to be oqſerved.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That all large diſcourſes and ſpeeches be avoided: <hi>In multiloquio non deeſt peccatum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That no perſonall matters tending to complaints or reproaches be heard in any publick meetings, but that the perſons appointed to redreſſe grievances, ſhould be made acquainted therewith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That no diſputatory conferences by way of contradiction to different opinions, be entertained, but only declaratory by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of each his own opinion in <hi>theſi &amp; antitheſi,</hi> and by way of deliberation what is more or leſſe expedient, be allowed: &amp; that in all ſuch conferences the ſum of that wherein on each ſide there is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, be noted &amp; put to paper by the Scribes, that wherin opinions may be different, the Scribes ſhall not be obliged to take notice of.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the conferences which may be between both parties, I would ad Adviſe theſe things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If it ſhould not be permitted to any to make any ſpeech, or large diſcourſe either in his own name, or in the name of any other, far leſs to make complaints of grievances, &amp; oblige others to make apologies and recriminations theſe kinds of conferences have ruined our peace, chiefly when proud men, or paſſionate talkers have taken upon them to out-wit others, and manage the affaires of their own party to the diſadvantage of the other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That no matter of conference ſhould be mentioned at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon meeting, but ſuch as in writing is delivered from one ſide to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That concerning ſuch matters no conference ſhould be further entertained than that it ſhal be free for any one of either ſide to ask a queſtion of thoſe that have delivered a paper concerning their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any thing contained therein; and that it ſhal be free for the treaters of that ſide to whom the queſtion is propoſed, firſt to explain the meaning of the writing which is counted doubtful; &amp; in caſe they open it not fully enough, that then any other of the ſame ſide may adde to what the Treaters ſhall have delivered.</p>
                  <p>And beyond theſe bounds no conference ſhould be allowed, nor matters of debate otherwiſe entertained than in writing, either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratorily or deliberatively: Declaratorily in reference to the grounds of our judgement and practice: deliberatively in reference to the wayes and expedients of edification in love and agreement.</p>
